//! cpal-backed audio output for the engine reimplementation track.
//!
//! Two layers:
//!
//! - [`spu`] - a clean-room model of the PSX SPU: 24 voices, 512 KB SPU RAM,
//!   ADSR-shaped envelopes, libspu-shaped transfer engine. Drives the
//!   actual playback every output frame at 44.1 kHz internal rate. This is
//!   what the engine reimplementation track uses to render in-game audio.
//!
//! - [`AudioOut`] - a single cpal output stream that owns an [`spu::Spu`]
//!   instance behind a `Mutex`, ticking it once per host-rate output sample
//!   (with linear resampling from the SPU's 44.1 kHz to the device rate).
//!   The asset viewer also gets a "play this VAG sample as a one-shot"
//!   convenience path that materialises a one-block stream into SPU RAM,
//!   sets up voice 0, and key-ons it through the same SPU model.
//!
//! No Sony bytes - this is a clean-room port from the libspu API surface
//! and the PSX hardware register layout (see `docs/subsystems/audio.md`).

//! Tick-driven sequencer: drives a [`crate::Spu`] from a parsed
//! [`legaia_seq::Seq`] + a loaded [`crate::vab_bind::VabBank`].
//!
//! Models the public surface of Sony's libsnd SsAPI sequencer
//! (`SsSeqOpen`/`SsSeqPlay`/`SsSeqClose`/`SsSeqSetVol`) without copying any
//! Sony bytes. The mapping it implements:
//!
//! - One sequencer drives **one** SEQ + **one** VAB bank.
//! - Channels 0..=15 map to **logical voice slots**; the sequencer assigns
//!   physical SPU voices on key-on by linear scan over the 24 voices, picks
//!   the first idle one, and remembers the `(channel, key) → voice` binding
//!   so the matching key-off can shut it down.
//! - Tempo is stored as microseconds-per-quarter-note; the SsAPI runtime
//!   advances a tick clock at `ppqn` ticks per quarter note.
//! - Timing uses an **exact integer accumulator** clocked in SPU samples
//!   (44.1 kHz) - no floating-point per-tick rate, so there is no drift on
//!   long tracks and playback is bit-deterministic. The accumulator counts
//!   in units of `sample × ppqn × 1_000_000`; an event whose delta is
//!   `d` ticks fires once the accumulator reaches `d × tempo_us × 44100`
//!   (the algebraic rearrangement of `elapsed_seconds ≥ d × tempo_us /
//!   (ppqn × 1e6)`), which keeps every term an integer.
//! - Tempo events from the SEQ override the running tempo at the event
//!   time (matching libsnd's mid-stream `0xFF 0x51`).
//! - Loop points are read **from the stream**: PSX SEQ encodes them as
//!   NRPN-style control changes on status `0xB0` - controller 99 (`0x63`)
//!   value 20 = Loop Start, value 30 = Loop Forever. When a Loop Start fires
//!   the sequencer remembers the position; a later Loop Forever (or an
//!   end-of-track that follows a Loop Start) rewinds to that marker rather
//!   than to the beginning. An external [`Sequencer::set_loop_to`] remains as
//!   a fallback for the handful of retail tracks that carry no markers.
//!
//! Tests use synthetic SEQs + a stubbed `VabBank` shape so no Sony bytes
//! are ever instantiated.
